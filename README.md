### Why I do what I do

I work on problems where:
- data is abundant, but insight is scarce  
- correlation stands in for causation  
- data projects quietly fail due to gaps between domain knowledge and analysis  

I believe most data-informed decisions are currently costly, distracting, and often sends organisations down the wrong path.

### How I work

- **no data, no service**  
  work starts with real data, not dashboards  

- **no decision context, no data**  
  data is collected *because* a decision must be made  

- **actions require causal reasoning**  
  patterns describe the past  
  causes explain what happens *if we intervene*  

- **data stays close to its source**  
  ownership, context, and responsibility matter  

- **decisions spread faster than products**  
  agree on *how to decide*, and software follows

### What I build

- business & policy analytics  
- regulatory and compliance intelligence  
- decision systems where explanation matters as much as prediction  

Sometimes this results in software.  
Often, the real work happens upstream, through consulting.

### Current focus

- business analytics (MSc)  
- causal reasoning & causal AI (Pearl, DoWhy, SCMs)  
- production analytics systems built on purposeful data collection
