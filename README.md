this is a return.  
not a debut.

fragments. functions. thoughts.  
drifted. recovered. rebroadcast.

**oozr is not the source.**  
**it’s the signal.**

I work on problems where:
- data exists, but creates more noise than insight  
- correlation is treated as cause, quietly and repeatedly  

---

### How I work

- **no data, no service**  
  work starts with real data, not dashboards  

- **no decision context, no data**  
  data is collected *because* a decision must be made  

- **actions require causal reasoning**  
  patterns describe the past  
  causes explain what happens *if we intervene*  

- **data stays close to its source**  
  ownership, context, and responsibility matter  

- **decisions spread faster than products**  
  agree on *how to decide*, and software follows  

---

### What I build

- business & policy analytics  
- regulatory and compliance intelligence  
- decision systems where explanation matters as much as prediction  

Sometimes this results in software.  
Often, the real work happens upstream, through consulting.

### Current focus

- business analytics (MSc)  
- causal reasoning & causal AI (Pearl, DoWhy, SCMs)  
- production analytics systems built on purposeful data collection
