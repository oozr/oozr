### Why I do what I do

I work on problems where:
- data is abundant, but insight is scarce  
- correlation stands in for causation  
- data projects quietly fail due to gaps between domain knowledge and analysis  

I believe most data-informed decisions are currently costly, distracting, and often sends organisations down the wrong path.

### How I work

- **Rule 1: No data, no service**  
  work starts with real data, not dashboards  
- **Rule 2: No decision context, no data**  
  data is collected *because* a decision must be made  
- **Rule 3: Actions require causal reasoning**  
  patterns describe the past, causes explain what happens *if we intervene*  
- **Rule 4: Data stays close to its source**  
  ownership, context, and responsibility matter  
- **Rule 5: Decisions spread faster than products**  
  agree on *how to decide*, and software follows

### What I build

- business & policy analytics
- educational tools based on linguistic data
- decision systems where explanation matters as much as prediction  

Sometimes this results in software. Often, the real work happens upstream, through consulting.

### Current focus

- business analytics (MSc at Aston University)  
- causal reasoning & causal AI (Pearl, DoWhy, SCMs)  
- production analytics systems built on purposeful data collection
